This is a sales management system using c# and mysql. 
It supports multiuser login- admin, customer and supplier in which different user roles can see and do different things.

Go to /DB folder to get the .sql file which you can import into your mysql.
The connection code is done individually in all forms so it might take a while to change the server name, host name, username and password (sorry).

This project is incomplete but as of now, customer can place an order for an item and an admin can see the items ordered for.

Admin can add items, view customers, view suppliers and manipulate orders.
